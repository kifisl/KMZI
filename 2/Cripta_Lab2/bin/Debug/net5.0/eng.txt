Animals are in danger all over the world. Some animals are in danger because people want to wear their fur. Others, like elephants, are killed for their tusks which become necklaces and decorations. But many animals are in danger because man is destroying their environment - cutting down forests, building roads and houses or polluting the places where these animals live.
